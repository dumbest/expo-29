This project was created with `create-react-native-app` before it was merged into Expo (of version 30.0.0). The new `expo init` has some issue with Realm in production build of Android app. It always crash on launch. This donesn't affect iOS (development and release) and Android (development).

If you still want support for Realm in detach/eject mode, use this as scaffold for your project.
